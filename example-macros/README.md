This folder contains example macros that can be used as a starting point for creating your own macros.

Note: make sure your macro is in the correct format. The macro should be a folder with the `index.ts` or `index.js` file at the root of the folder as the entry point.

PRs are welcome! If you have a macro you'd like to share, feel free to create a PR to add it to this folder.
