## Supported Platforms and Architectures
- Windows (x86_64)
- Linux (x86_64 and ARM)
- MacOS (Apple Silicon)

We are deprecating support for Intel Macs due to the lack of hardware to test on. Get in contact with us if you would like to see additional platform supports.

## Lodestone CLI vs Lodestone Desktop

Lodestone CLI manages the installation and updates of Lodestone Core - the backend of Lodestone. It does not come with a UI (dashboard), so you must use a web dashboard, either hosted by us or yourself.

Lodestone Desktop integrates Lodestone Core and the dashboard into a single application. It is available for Windows only and is not considered stable yet.


## Installation

### Docker
See [here](https://github.com/Lodestone-Team/lodestone/wiki/Docker-Support)

### Windows
You can download Lodestone Desktop for Windows from the [releases page](https://github.com/Lodestone-Team/lodestone/releases). Although we recommend using the CLI, see below.


### Linux and MacOS (Apple Silicon) via CLI
Download and run [Lodestone CLI](https://github.com/Lodestone-Team/lodestone_cli).

If you would like to use the dashboard we hosts:
1. Use a chromium based browser (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.) and go to [https://www.lodestone.cc/](https://www.lodestone.cc/)
2. Follow this [guide](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/target/using/experiences/vec/troubleshoot-composer/mixed-content.html?lang=en) to enable mixed content for the site.
3. If you have browser extensions such as HTTPS Everywhere, disable them for the site.

To see why step 2 and 3 are necessary and some possible solutions, see [here](https://github.com/Lodestone-Team/lodestone/wiki/FAQ#why-do-i-need-to-enable-mixedinsecure-content-and-disable-https-is-this-safe)

Alternatively, you can host the dashboard yourself.

## Safety & Security

Lodestone Core is written entirely in safe Rust, and uses`#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`. However **we can't guarantee the safety of the crates and binaries we link to**, as those may use unsafe rust.

Lodestone is created with security as a top priority. While most of the safety critical code such as login and permissions management have been tested thoroughly, **no formal security audit has been done for any part of Lodestone.**


## Contributing

Lodestone is still new and we have *a lot* of features planned for this year. Either way, we'd love to hear your feedback! If you have any suggestions, leave a GitHub issue or talk to us on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/PkHXRQXkf6).
